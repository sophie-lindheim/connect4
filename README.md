# connect4
a connect 4 game, implemented by Krisztian &amp; Sophie for the class "SEM1"

The description and planning of the project is in "Projects" visible and under "Issues" the
single steps of the process can be followed. This has been managed throughout the whole 
project, so the timelyiness and the progress can be tracked.


The game is located in the c4_class.py file, can be started by creating an object
of the C4Game class and calling the main function"connect4()" with this object. For example:<br>
g = C4Game()<br>
g.connect4()<br>
From there the rules and the instructions are included in the game.

Have fun!
